explanation_title=How will this impact me?
explanation_technologist=Technologist
explanation_technologist_desc=The proposal would make sharing and accessing news online more difficult. It would force most online platforms to monitor all content you post — like YouTube videos, Facebook comments, and DeviantArt submissions.
explanation_creator_innovator=Creator / Innovator
explanation_creator_innovator_desc=Everyone in Europe should have the right to remix, create parodies, and share their ideas online — all the forms of expression that make the internet wonderful. The current proposal doesn’t include an exception for everyday user generated content.
explanation_scientists_librarian=Scientist / Librarian
explanation_scientists_librarian_desc=The proposal only allows scientific research institutions to mine text and datasets, but we think more people — like librarians, journalists, and independent scientists — should be able to access the information they need to discover innovative solutions for Europe.
