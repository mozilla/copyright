main_title=Stand up for the internet we love
tagline=Right now an epic battle is playing out over Copyright Reform. Key things that make the internet awesome are at stake.
get_involved_button=GET INVOLVED

main_description=Think copyright reform doesn’t affect you? Consider this: If you’ve ever been on social media, shared a link, created a funny meme, uploaded an awesome video, or appreciated the creativity the internet has to offer, then copyright reform matters to you.

question_1=Do you agree nobody wins when creativity is stifled?
answer_1=What they call upload filters would force most online platforms to monitor all content you post online. This would stifle creativity and create a prohibitive culture for innovation and expression online.
question_2=Do you like sharing and receiving information online?
answer_2=The proposal to introduce a new “neighboring right for press publishers” would make the sharing and accessing of news and information online more difficult.
question_3=Do you agree artists, innovators, and creators are important?
answer_3=User generated content is a huge part of the internet. We should be adapting copyright to the way information today is remixed and shared as a form of expression — whether for political commentary or for sheer comedic value.
copyright_matters=If you answered yes, then copyright reform matters to you.

now_what_title=Now What?
now_what_tagline=Stand with Mozilla and defend the internet for people
now_what_description=European policy makers are making important decisions around copyright right now. Institutions like major press publishers and the recording industry are pushing their self-serving agenda. If policy makers give in to their demands, many parts of the internet that we know and love, will die. Let’s fight back to keep the Web open and healthy.
